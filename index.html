        <h2>What is Love?</h2>
        <p>I've been asked this question many times,<br>
        What is love? Let's see if I can describe;<br>
        Love is respect, love is loyalty,<br>
        Love is madness that goes beyond reality;<br>
        Love is worship, love is care,<br>
        Love is the hand caressing your hair;<br>
        Love is peace but love is chaos too,<br>
        Love is totally a dream come true;<br>
        Love is hope, love is faith,<br>
        Love is sometimes a little hate;<br>
        Love is friendship but love also betrays,<br>
        Love is finding your person in a room filled with snakes;<br>
        Love is truth but love also lies,<br>
        Love is a heartbreak in disguise;<br>
        Love is pure, love is divine,<br>
        Love is spending some quality time;<br>
        Love is hello, love is goodbye,<br>
        Love is what makes you want to cry;<br>
        Love is selfless but love is selfish too,<br>
        Love is not always black and white sometimes it's blue;<br>
        Love is comfort, love is support,<br>
        Love is what hurts the most;<br>
        Love is all the cute little stuff,<br>
        Love is also what makes you tough;<br>
        Love is you and love is me,<br>
        Love is holding on, love is letting go,<br>
        Love is what we all are living for;<br>
        There is no proper definition of it that's completely true,<br>
        At last love is love,<br>
        Love is everything that makes you, you;<br>
        </p>
        <p>You make my world brighter every day. Will you marry me?</p>
        <p>Would you like to go out on a date with me?</p>
