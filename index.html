        <p>I had a little crush on you since then. Like your facial expressions, your hair, your childlike innocence. Then I asked you for my startup, which actually is shut now lol!!!</p>
        <p>I told about you to Anjali as well. HEHHEHEHEHE</p>

        <p>We had no contact for a long time. I wanted to ask you out on prom, but I couldn't. And then got a better chance in Sem 2 to know you more. Got to know your mindset and in some things we are very similar, in some we are very different.</p>
        <p>And dude, SINDHI NAHI HU MEI, BUT BANIYA HU, AND BUSSINESS FAMILY S ATA HU</p>

        <p>So I'll be honest with you. I am a person who is very toxic for his work. My work, My career is my life. Even right now I am doing 2 internships, I really want to work for RBI in future. But I am very uncertain about my career as well. Mood swings bhut atee hai.</p>
        <p>I admire and love very few people in college. I was in a relationship for 3 years. Her name was Anjali. We loved each other madly, she was senior to me and now she is moving to Columbia for her MBA. She was a CA before that. We only broke up because that is a permanent long distance, and we both didn't have that patience. We cried a lot, it took a toll on my health as well to move on. But with the help of some coffee and my friends, I did. And she is also trying. heheheh</p>
        <p>Tbh, we had no reason to breakup. For both of us, we were the one. I am telling you all these things because you should know.</p>

        <p>Samya!! I am a person who doesn't want to be with lots of people in his life. I firmly believe in the concept of the one. I can't commit I'll be with the person lifelong because that is a false promise tbh. But I can commit, "Jab tak hu, pura try krunga".</p>
        <p>I always judge a partner for me on a report card on a scale of 10 and no one is 10/10. I believe if a person is 6/10 or 7/10 and can evolve to become 9/10, it is worth it.</p>
        <p>I don't run for labels. I told you this before. I don't care whether I date you as my partner, or idk.... I like your crazy free vibe. What matters is your presence. The presence of you is more important, whether it's in the form of friendship or more than that or maybe less than that.</p>
        <p>And that thing is lifelong.</p>

        <p>I know we are different on many levels, but the one thing I like most about you is you love yourself, you love your career. And that matters to me the most. And that is the most attractive thing tbh.</p>
        <p>Tu Dream Vali Hai<br>Me Khwab Wala Hun<br>Tu Screen Vali Hai<br>Me Kitaab Wala Hun</p>
        <p>Tu Dream Vali Hai<br>Me Khwab Wala Hun<br>Tu Screen Vali Hai<br>Me Kitaab Wala Hun</p>
        <p>Can I have a chance to know you more, a bit better?</p>
        <p>She craves to be loved like a poem,<br>Want to be admired like an art,<br>Where verses are phrased in such a way,<br>Just to melt a certain person's heart;</p>
